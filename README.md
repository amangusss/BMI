# BMI Calculator Project

This project is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented using JavaFX.

## Description

The BMI calculator supports two units of measurement: pounds/inches and kilograms/meters. The user can enter their weight and height, and the application will calculate their BMI.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main classes - `BMIController` and `BMI`. The `BMIController` class defines methods for handling user actions in the graphical interface. The `BMI` class is the entry point to the application and loads the user interface from the BMI.fxml file.

## Usage

To use the BMI calculator, simply enter your weight and height, then select your unit of measurement (pounds/inches or kilograms/meters), and press the "Calculate" button to get your BMI.

## Installation
